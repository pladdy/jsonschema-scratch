jsonschema-scratch
==================

This is a jsonschema and flask sandbox.  This enables setting up some jsonschemas and make
them available via a HTTP interface.

Goals:

- complex JSON schemas that can be resolved if they have references
  - IE DRY up schemas by sharing components but be able to view a schema de-referencedÂ´
- store schemas in an embedded db (sqlite?)?  or just use the file system?
  - sqlite has json functions
  - instead of a file structure just have table(s)
  - if i use a db schemas need to be easy to discover (ie see a list like a filesystem?)
    - how do i list them now in flask?
- version schemas so you can update them
  - not sure if it makes sense to require a version # in the json schema, but perhaps in the db?

API
---

0.1.0
~~~~~

- [x] ``GET /schemas/<some-schema-file.json>``
  - shows the schema file, might have $refs in it
- [ ] ``GET /schemas/<some-schema-file.json>?resolve``
  - shows the schema file but resolved, refs file refs substituted (not local refs though)
- [x] ``POST /schemas/<some-schema-file.json>?validate``
  - this doesn't seem like the right interface...

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
      "schema": "",
      "document": {}
    }

TODO
----

- when calling /schemas/ to view, if it's a dir, create links to the files so you can just click on it
- create validate blueprint and a schemas blueprint?
- print exceptions better, look into traceback
  - https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/traceback.html
- can post a schema
